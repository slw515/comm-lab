        <p class="blog-text">For this assignment, we decided to create a fictional comic strip involving the "birds" of the palm trees conspiracy.
        In brief, this is the conspiracy that the bird noises that you can hear at the palm trees are fake and are actually audio played by the university
        through speakers on top of the trees.   <br><br> Because we were basing this comic off of a lighthearted, funny conspiracy, we did many things to
        create this mood and experience through the comic. By making the characters and the environment cartoon-like, made with brushes in Illustrator, the idea
        of a personified bird taking offense at reading a Tweet about how it is fake seemed to be captured perfectly.<br><br> Furthermore, we also aimed to poke fun at the
        conspiracy by revealing a fake bird in the palm trees, not through the sounds of a speaker, but an actual robot-bird making these sounds.
        The bird's personality is also something we created that we believed would make the comic and situation more funny, the creation of such a bird with seemingly
        complext human emotions is off the wall and amusing for viewers of the comic.

            <h1>Wireframes</h1>
            <p class="blog-text">I was tasked with developing the wireframes for this project after a short meeting we had. Our initial plan to use the palm trees
            as a background and having a horizontal slideshow display the different panels was implemented as planned. However, as can be seen in the second wireframe,
            we intended to use a vertical movement in one of the animations, specifically the part when the bird decides to defecate on the unsuspecting person.
            Unfortunately, we did not have the technical skills to implement this, especially the the Javascript/CSS library that we decided to use to create the slideshow of panels</p>

          As stated above we intended for the project to be a horizontal slideshow with
          users being able to interact with different parts of the screen when prompted to do
          so to create further animations and advance the comic. There were a few aspects of this
          that we unfortunately were not able to implement, but we were satisfied with the use of a
          few buttons to prompt advances in the comic and the use of the slideshow. My role was implementing
          the interface by designing and coding the website. I also animated the drawings that Yulia created
          by turning them into GIFs using Photoshop. Yulia drew all of the comics that we used in the comic. Naeema
          photoshopped the background images we used and found the library we used to create the comic (Ninja Slider).

            <h1>Reflection</h1>
            <p class="blog-text">
              Overall, I think my expectations were largely met with this project. Because I am extremely interested in web development
              and animation, I really enjoyed working on creating the animations (even if they were simple GIFs), and found trying to
              implement the front-end as a enjoyable and useful experience. With my limited experience doing front-end web development,
              I realized it would be difficult to create a seamless comic experience. I was especially frustrated with not being able to reload
              the animation sequences of different panels if the user decided to click on the them again. I also became frustrated with trying to make sure
              buttons and images were in their right place, and believe that our website is terribly unresponsive. Working with the framework without any knowledge
              of it was also frustrating. Even though it made things a lot easier than coding it from scratch, it was hard to get the framework to accomplish
              subtle changes that me and the group wanted. Overall, I would say that my expectations for the website were realized, but I was not able to accomplish
              the goals I wanted to accomplish the most. I think that we were able to accomplish our goal of creating a fun, lighthearted comic about one of NYUAD's
              favorite urban legends, and that we had several interactive elements that allowed users to navigate this story.
