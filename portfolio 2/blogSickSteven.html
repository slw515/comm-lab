        <p class="blog-text">For this assignment, we had to develop a website using HTML, CSS and Javascript to promote a fictional
        film we created on the first day of class. <br><br> Because the film that we produced was lighthearted and humorous, I decided to
        make a "brighter" website that evoked the same emotions one had when watching the film. <br><br> I was also inspired by the "Diary
        of a Wimpy Kid" book series, a personal favorite of mine, and it's simple hand-drawn aesthetic depicting ridiculous events that the
        main character finds himself in. Although I was not able to create such a "notebook" feel, this was the reason why I chose white and why
        I designed the logo the way it is.</p>

            <h1>Wireframes</h1>
            <p class="blog-text">I feel like the style of the website that I intended to produce for this project did not change much from my wireframes,
            which I made using Adobe XD. However, the actual functionality and features greatly changed. I intended to have a gallery page, but when I realized
            that I did not have many images to use, I feel that it may be out of place on the website. I also realized that writing script for a gallery would
            be difficult. The cinema searcher that I intended to make would also be difficult, so I decided to exclude that as well. I also decided to change the
            landing page as well, so that it would feature the trailer/the movie itself. I initially intended to have a fully-stretched image as the background
            of the landing page, but finding/taking such an image would be difficult.</p>

        <h1>The Landing Page</h1>
        <p class="blog-text">The landing page includes a basic navigation bar, my centered trailer, two social media links in the footer, two buttons
        that feature calls to action, and a simple animation at the bottom I produced using jQuery and CSS.<br><br>I wanted the landing page to be simple and clean, and
        I wanted users to be able to see the movie right when they entered the website, especially because the movie is extremely short. </p>

        <h1>The About Page</h1>
        <p class="blog-text">The about page is where I tried to use the most Javascript and effects, mostly because this was the only page that was longer
        than the height of standard web page sizes. This allowed me to create animations on scroll, and focus on designing the layout and where many of these
        elements should go and what stylistic features they should possess. <br><br> Scroll effects included two "appear" functions which revealed elements to
        the user when they scrolled to a certain height. I also created a shrink navigation effect using CSS that shrunk the middle logo so that the rest of the
        navigation bar would shrink once the user scrolled down to a certain height. I also designed a fixed footer and header that stayed with the user as they
        scrolled the page</p>

        <h1>The Register Page</h1>
        <p class="blog-text">The register page is a very basic page that prompts users to submit their name and email addresses.<br><br> This page is not very
        functional, although it does give a Javascript alert when the button is pressed. There is no customization of the response and the alert still appears
        even if nothing is inputted by the users into the fields. </p>

        <h1>The Store</h1>
        <p class="blog-text">The store is where I displayed various apparel items, including the infamous pen from the movie, and allowed users to choose a size
        and "purchase" items <br><br> I used hrefs to create a "horizontal" link effect, although this was not one page but featured multiple with each of the items.
        Similar to the register button/alert, pressing "Add to Cart" with nothing selected will call the alert function, and the response lacks customization depending
        on what the user selected. </p>

            <h1>Final Reflection</h1>
            <p class="blog-text">Overall, I am happy with the website I created, I feel like I fulfilled my goal of creating a playful, yet simple website that fit
            the ridiculous, off-beat humour that our movie attempted to have. I wish that I had attempted to be a little more ambitious by creating the gallery I designed
            in my wireframe, and at times I wish that I had used a more ambitious color scheme because, although I think that white is effective, I was playing it safe by not
            using a different color scheme</p>
